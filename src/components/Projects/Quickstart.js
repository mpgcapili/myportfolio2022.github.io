                    <H2>01 Getting Information</H2>
                    <P>So I was tasked to Redesign and improve the UX and UI of the website. As always I gather first some information before creating design.</P>
                    <p>In this case, I asked the following main questions:</p>
                    <ul className='list-disc pl-6 mb-4'>
                        <li>What part of website annoys you?</li>
                        <li>What part of website you think needs improvement?</li>
                        <li>Any feature you think is nice to have?</li>
                        <li>What kind of users uses it?</li>
                        <li>Do we need to be responsive?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <P>After getting all information, I organized them and prioritize which one should be tackled first.</P>
                </div>
                <div className='ideation-and-wireframe'>
                    <H2>02 Ideation and Wireframe</H2>
                    <P>After getting the information, i proceed to create some mockups.</P>
                    <P>Usually I started the design from mobile first approach, but at the time I started the project, the lead of the project told me responsiveness is not a priority.</P>
                    <P>So with that in mind, I focus myself to focus the improvement and redesigning using web size.</P>

                <div className='feedback-testing-and-iteration'>
                    <H2>03 Feedback/Testing and Iteration</H2>
                    <P>After mockups, I presented it to them. A lot of changes was made.</P>

                    <P>I spent most of my time on the Score cards, because it has man details that needs to put in 1 card and it should make sense. So it was pretty hard. Below is my initial version.</P>
                    <Image src={scorecardv1} subtitle="Initial design I made for scorecards" />
                    <P>But after I presented it to them, the feedback I get is it is too long in height. Scorecards are summaries, so when a user logins to the site, they should be able to
                        see all summary detail for the 1st scorecard they will see.
                    </P>

                            <P>Each card represents some kind of summary specifically for one unique server, but the data that being presented is all over the place</P>

                            <p>So here are the main problems on the card:</p>

                                <li>Have poor visual hierarchy.</li>

                            <ul className='list-decimal pl-6 mb-4'>
                                <li>Use proper Font weights to indicate hierarchy.</li>
                                <li>Introduce fix spacing around information and groups.</li>
                                <li>Introduce a circle symbol to indicate level and to avoid cognitive overload.</li>

                            <P>Also with this design, I was able to somehow make the height a little bit shorter compare to the initial redesign I made.</P>

                    <P>This mostly on the UX side, I learned a little bit more about proper usage of negative space.</P>
                    <P>Because even though I change the negative spaces around element and change the padding, margin, font size, font weight, I still manage to retain the original size and did not take up too much space.</P>
                    <P>I know there is still much to learn, and I will keep doing so.</P>
